I am writing this in response to my friend's blog post, which you can check out [here](http://zebralibra.blogspot.com/2024/12/is-adjuster-real-life-batman-or-just.html). I recommend giving it a read and following their blog, as it is worth your time.

### TL;DR
I fully support him.

## The Manifesto and Its Merit
-----------------------------

I wholeheartedly agree with the Adjustor's manifesto, which you can read [here](https://archive.ph/qb9H0). Regardless of whether it is actually the Adjustor or someone posing as him, all of the statements are true. The Adjustor's actions, as described, represent a clear case of self-defense against a system that perpetuates inequality and injustice. The Adjustor's methods may be unconventional, but their intentions are rooted in a desire to protect the vulnerable and hold the powerful accountable.

### **Addressing Counterpoints**

**"But he had a family"** \
Having a family does not excuse one's actions, nor does it justify the harm caused to others. Historical figures like Hitler, who had a wife and a niece, are often cited as examples of individuals who committed heinous crimes despite having loved ones. The fact that someone has a family does not automatically grant them a moral free pass. In fact, it's often the case that those who have families are more accountable for their actions, as they have a responsibility to set a good example and provide for their loved ones. 

**Wasn't the Adjustor just doing his job?** \
This criticism is a classic example of the "just following orders" defense, which has been widely discredited as a legitimate excuse for morally reprehensible actions. Simply doing one's job does not justify harming others, especially when that job involves perpetuating a system of oppression.

**Is violence ever an acceptable solution?** \
While violence is not ideal, it is essential to acknowledge that the proletariat may have felt they had no other choice. Past attempts at change through lawful means have been unsuccessful, and it took an individual's bold action to spark change.

**What if it was your dad?** \
If my father was such a monster, I would have killed him myself

**But the adjuster is rich** \
This criticism actually strengthens the Adjustor's case, as he was willing to give up his privileged life and risk everything to fight for a cause he believes in, demonstrating his selflessness and commitment to justice. Moreover, his wealth means he doesn't face the same struggles as those he's fighting for, such as inaccessible healthcare. He has the means to afford the best medical care, yet he's taking a stand for those who are denied this basic right, further highlighting his dedication to the cause.

## The Root of the Problem
-------------------------

The root of all evil, as always, stems from capitalism. It actively encourages people to engage in exploitative practices, such as those of the CEO mentioned. These individuals exploit thousands of people for their own gain, and yet, people continue to defend them by arguing that they "worked for their money." No millionaire has ever truly worked for their money; perhaps the first few hundred thousand, but after that, it's all about exploiting others. There isn't a single moral billionaire.

## A Message to Americans
-------------------------

I feel a deep sense of sorrow for the struggles you face every day, living in a society with so much propaganda, so much death. The Adjustor's actions may be a desperate cry for help, a call to attention to the injustices that plague your society. My heart goes out to you, and I hope that one day, you will be free from the shackles of capitalism.

It's time for you to rise up and demand change. The system is broken, and it's up to you to fix it. Don't be afraid to protest, to speak out against injustice, and to fight for what's rightfully yours. The Adjustor's actions may be extreme, but they are a testament to the desperation and frustration that many of you feel.

And when you see the Adjustor, remember that the bourgeoisie may be out of touch, but they are not out of reach. They may think they are above the law, above mortality, but they are not. They are human beings, just like you, and they can bleed just like us.

But be aware, the bourgeoisie will try to divide you. Its never been right vs left. It's about the powerful elite exploiting the working class, and it's time for you to recognize that. Don't let them distract you with petty squabbles and partisan politics. See the bigger picture, and unite against the true enemy: the system that perpetuates inequality and injustice.

You are not alone, and you are not powerless. The Adjustor's actions have shown that even one person can make a difference. Imagine what you can achieve together, as a united front against the forces of oppression.
